Welcome! 

This is GitHub repo where I am hosting lecture notes for SDS383D (Statistical Modeling II). The syllabus for this course is also hosted here as `Syllabus.pdf`. 

Students who want to can clone the repository and add solutions to exercises by opening up the relevant chapter and adding

    :::{.solution}
    
    Markdown code for my solution goes here.
    
    :::

Assuming that the student is using **RStudio** and has the appropriate packages installed, opening the .Rproj file and building the site should make a website with your solution added.
